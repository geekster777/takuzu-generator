This is a simple tazuku validator. It currently generates random takuzu boards 
and will tell you if they are valid. Even if they are incomplete. 

Takuzu is a number game similar to sudoku. You only have 1's and 0's. In each 
row and column, there must be the same number of 1's and 0's, and no row or 
column can be the same.
