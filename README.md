This is a simple tazuku generator. It generates a random takuzu board based on
a sent in a command line argument. If no size is sent, it defaults to size 8.

Takuzu is a number game similar to sudoku. You only have 1's and 0's. In each 
row and column, there must be the same number of 1's and 0's, and no row or 
column can be the same.
